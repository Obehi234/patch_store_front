# Processes Implemented

- # API Integration
    - The store fetches product data from the Fake Store API, fetching a list of 50 random products.
    - Each product has its details as defined in the Product Data Class - Product title, category, price and image.

- # Filtering and Sorting
 -The app has also been configured to handle sorting in various ways :
  - Sorting by highest price (By clicking on the button with text ["By Highest Price"])
  - Sorting by lowest price which re-arranges the product list from lowest to highest price
  - Sorting by category

- # Caching with SharedPreferences
  The cart items were stored with shared preferences to reduce wait time for the user
